Introduction</a>
</h1>

<p>
This document is a part of the ongoing effort to bring <tt>PHOEBE </tt>closer to its users. Here you will find step-by-step instructions for using <tt>PHOEBE </tt>for the first time. When you get acquainted with the main ideas and design, you may find the <tt>PHOEBE </tt>Reference Manual (which doesn't exist at the time) more instructive.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00021000000000000000">
<tt>PHOEBE</tt> Licence</a>
</h2>

<p>
<tt>PHOEBE </tt>is released under a <code>GNU</code> General Public Licence. A copy of this licence is distributed along <tt>PHOEBE </tt>and you may find it in a file <code>COPYING</code> in a base <tt>PHOEBE </tt>directory. To quote the most important part:

</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software-to
make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code

pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>For example, if you distribute copies of such a
program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright
the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to
make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for

passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
all.

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Some general remarks about <tt>PHOEBE</tt></a>
</h2>

<p>
Although this document is a tutorial and as such doesn't even tend to cover all <tt>PHOEBE </tt>aspects, a few introductory lines are in order. Let us start by explaining the name: <tt>PHOEBE </tt>stands for <code>PH</code>ysics <code>O</code>f <code>E</code>clipsing <code>B</code>inari<code>E</code>s.

</p><p>
Probably the most important thing for any new <tt>PHOEBE </tt>user is to understand the limitations and capabilities of this software. Although <tt>PHOEBE </tt>aims to be as useful as possible, it still tends to follow the basic principle of simplicity. In other words: although <tt>PHOEBE </tt>may
assist you in solving your specific problem, it won't write an article
for you or even make you a good cup of coffee; that is still up to you.
</p><p>
To describe <tt>PHOEBE </tt>in one sentence: for a set of user-supplied experimental light curves and radial velocity curves <tt>PHOEBE </tt>estimates physical parameters of an eclipsing binary that theoretically best matches the data.

</p><p>
The basic goal of <tt>PHOEBE </tt>is to aid you with intuitive
interface through the pain of solving this problem. Since the dimension
of the parameter phase-space is tremendous and the inverse problem for
eclipsing binaries itself highly non-linear, this task is hard to live
up to and <tt>PHOEBE </tt>is thus subject to constant changes and improvements. Hopefully each new version  converges to a global optimum.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000">
First steps with <tt>PHOEBE</tt></a>
</h1>

<p>
In this section we will take <tt>PHOEBE </tt>for a spin to get a
feeling about what it can do for us. We shall start with proper
configuration, continue with inspecting the overall structure and
finally, demonstrate how the data is supplied to the program.
</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00031000000000000000">
Configuring <tt>PHOEBE</tt></a>
</h2>

<p>
<tt>PHOEBE </tt>may be installed in two ways: <span class="textit">system-wide</span>, meaning all users may use it, or <span class="textit">user-oriented</span>,
designated only for an individual user. These two differ only in the
location on the hard disk: the system-wide installation usually resides
in <code>/usr/local/share/phoebe</code> directory and the user-oriented installation in <code>/home/username/phoebe</code>.

</p><p>
We shall presume that your <tt>PHOEBE </tt>installation was successful; if not, please turn to installation instructions found in the top-level <tt>PHOEBE </tt>directory. For troubleshooting please refer to the appendices.

</p><p>
As most computer programs, <tt>PHOEBE </tt>must be set up before the first use. When you first start it, the following warning will appear:

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_configuration_warning"></a><a name="39"></a>
<table>
<caption align="bottom"><strong>Figure 1:</strong>
<tt>PHOEBE </tt>configuration warning.</caption>
<tbody><tr><td>
<div align="center">
<img src="phoebe_configuration_warning.png" alt="phoebe_configuration_warning" align="bottom" border="0">
<br>
</div></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>
This warning lets you know that <tt>PHOEBE </tt>was unable to find its configuration directory; this is a hidden directory in your personal <code>HOME</code> directory<a name="tex2html2" href="#foot43"><sup><span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> (usually <code>/home/username/.phoebe</code>). By clicking on <code>OK</code> button this directory will be created and <tt>PHOEBE </tt>will take you to the configuration window (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_configuration_window">2</a>). If you decide not to create this directory, you may click on <code>Cancel</code> button, which will terminate <tt>PHOEBE</tt>.

</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_configuration_window"></a><a name="48"></a>
<table>
<caption align="bottom"><strong>Figure 2:</strong>
<tt>PHOEBE </tt>configuration window.</caption>
<tbody><tr><td>
<div align="center">
<img src="phoebe_configuration_window.png" alt="phoebe_configuration_window" align="bottom" border="0">
<br>
</div></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>
Configuration window is composed of two tabs: <tt>Files</tt> and <tt>Options</tt>. The first tab contains system-dependent file locations and the other contains options that reflect on the overall <tt>PHOEBE </tt>performance.

</p><p>
The default settings in the <tt>Files</tt> tab of the
configuration window are appropriate for the system-wide installation;
let us analyse the contents of these directories in turn:
</p><p>
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt></dt>
<dd>The <code>Base</code> directory is the directory of your current distribution; it contains generic distribution files such as the <code>README</code> file, <code>ChangeLog</code> file etc. It doesn't contain any execution-specific files.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The <code>Source</code> directory is a <code>Base</code> subdirectory and it contains <tt>PHOEBE </tt>sources (<code>.c</code> files and header files). This directory is optional, the generic <code>make install</code>
script won't install it for you. Sources are needed if you want to
build a binary package for your Linux distribution or if you want to
change the code.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The <code>Defaults</code> directory contains a single <tt>PHOEBE </tt>defaults file. This file, called <code>default.phoebe</code>, governs <tt>PHOEBE</tt>'s startup values: values of parameters with which <tt>PHOEBE </tt>starts.
Changing this file (either by hand or overwriting it with any other
keyword file) will change the default values permanently.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The <code>Working</code> directory is a temporary directory where <tt>PHOEBE </tt>stores all its I/O files. These files are intermediate <code>WD</code> files, logs, images etc. This directory obviously must have write permissions set, otherwise <tt>PHOEBE </tt>will issue a warning.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The <code>Data</code> directory is where <tt>PHOEBE </tt>expects to find user data (<tt>PHOEBE </tt>keyword files and LC/RV data files). For this directory also write permissions must be set.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The <code>WD LC</code> and <code>WD DC</code> directories set the location of Wilson-Devinney executables <code>lc</code> and <code>dc</code>. These are core files for <tt>PHOEBE </tt>and thus must be present.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The <code>WD Flux Files</code> directory is meant for future implementation. Since 2003, <code>WD</code>
algorithm changed the model from effective wavelength treatment to
integrated flux treatment, so to each experimental LC/RV curve there
will be a flux file assigned. This directory will contain these flux
files.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Other options include the choice of the plotting package<a name="tex2html4" href="#foot57"><sup><span class="arabic">2</span></sup></a>, limb darkening tables etc. We will talk about them later on, when we discuss their application.

</p><p>To change a specific directory, you may enter new pathnames
either by typing in the new values directly to the entry box, or by
clicking on the <code>Browse</code>
button and then selecting the right directory through a file selector.
The latter is preferable, since it is easy to make typing errors
otherwise.
</p><p>
The directory you will most probably want to change is the <code>Data</code> directory; it is advisable to create a dedicated directory somewhere in your home directory and supply it to <tt>PHOEBE</tt>, e.g. <tt>/home/username/data</tt>.

</p><p>
When finished, click on the <code>Save</code> button. The
settings will be saved, so you need to set it up only this one time. If
you want to review or modify your settings later, you may find them in <code>Settings-&gt;Configuration</code> menu. If you click on the <code>OK</code> button instead, the configuration will be kept for that <tt>PHOEBE </tt>session only. Clicking on <code>Cancel</code> will leave <tt>PHOEBE </tt>unconfigured. Strange things might happen...

</p><p>
When you are finished setting up, it's time to get some real work done!

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00032000000000000000">
<tt>PHOEBE</tt> structure</a>
</h2>

<p>
The main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window is divided in 9 <b>tabs</b> - screen pages with selected content that fits into a specific category (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_introductory_screenshot">3</a>). <code>Data</code> tab contains the information on experimental data, which is supplied by the user. <code>System-related</code>
tab holds all parameters that characterize the binary system as a whole
- such are the epoch parameters, semi-major axis, mass ratio and so on.
<code>Component-related</code> tab, in contrast, contains
curve-independent parameters that are characteristic of each star
individually, such as the effective temperature and gravity potentials.
<code>Orbit</code> tab contains parameters that describe the orbit,
like orbital ellipticity. There is planned support for Roche geometry
graphs. Next tab, <code>Luminosities</code>, contains curve-dependent
parameters: they have different values for different filters. Typical
parameters that fit into this category are flux levelers,<!-- MATH
 $3^{\mathrm{rd}}$
 -->
 <span class="MATH"><img src="img5.png" alt="$3^{\mathrm{rd}}$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="28"></span> light and weighting functions. <code>Limb darkening</code> and <code>Surface</code> tabs contain parameters that contribute in perturbative orders of corrections to curves. Finally, the <code>Fitting</code> tab contains functions and parameters that define and support minimization algorithms. <code>Utilities</code> tab holds functions that are not directly connected to <tt>PHOEBE </tt>and prototypes for functions to be implemented into <tt>PHOEBE </tt>shortly.

</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_introductory_screenshot"></a><a name="66"></a>

<div align="center">
<img src="phoebe_luminosities_tab.png" alt="phoebe_luminosities_tab" align="bottom" border="0">
<br>
</div></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>
Beside the main window there are three other types of <tt>PHOEBE </tt>windows. <b>Calculation</b>
windows help the user to quickly estimate the values of some specific
parameters, such as limb darkening coefficients and gravity potentials.
<b>Plotting</b> windows are meant for quick and simple eye inspections of both experimental and synthetic light and radial velocity curves. A <b>Fitting</b> window guides the user through the minimization process and iterative solution convergence. Finally, a <b>Scripter</b> window enables the user to write and execute powerful <tt>PHOEBE </tt>scripts.

</p><p>
All windows may be open at the same time because of the modular design of <tt>PHOEBE</tt>. It is up to you to decide the layout that suits you best, <tt>PHOEBE </tt>poses
no limitations in this respect. You may not, however, have more copies
of the same window, since the contents of one window might not be the
same as the contents of another instance of the same window and this
might lead to ambiguity problems.
</p><p>
The very top of the <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window is occupied by a drop-down menu. Here you will find other actions <tt>PHOEBE </tt>can perform.

</p><p>
On the bottom of the main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window there's a status bar (labelled <code>Last Event</code>), where <tt>PHOEBE </tt>notifies
you of all events when they are initiated. There is planned support for
history browsing and undoing unwanted changes, which will be closely
related to events in the status bar.
</p><p>
Finally, the lowermost part of the main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window is occupied with a button box. The buttons in this box let you quickly perform some specific operations. <code>Open</code> and <code>Save</code> buttons let you manipulate <tt>PHOEBE </tt>keyword files - files containing all the information about a certain star and are usually identified by the suffix <code>.phoebe</code>. The <code>Defaults</code> button restores all parameter values and entries to a state they were at startup. <code>LC Plot</code> and <code>RV Plot</code> buttons open the plotting windows, <code>Fitting</code> takes you to the fitting window, <code>Help</code> button will eventually bring up the online help screen, but this is not implemented yet. Finally, the <code>Exit</code> button closes all <tt>PHOEBE </tt>windows and exits the program.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00033000000000000000">
Getting started</a>
</h2>

<p>
During this tutorial, we shall try and find the preliminary solution of the <code>UV Leonis</code> binary system. <code>UV Leonis</code> is a detached close binary with coordinates <!-- MATH
 $\alpha_{\mathrm{2000}} = 10^h 38^m 20.7699^s$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img src="img7.png" alt="$\alpha_{\mathrm{2000}} = 10^h 38^m 20.7699^s$" align="middle" border="0" height="40" width="197"></span> and <!-- MATH
 $\delta_{\mathrm{2000}} = +14^o 16' 03.670''$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img src="img8.png" alt="$\delta_{\mathrm{2000}} = +14^o 16' 03.670''$" align="middle" border="0" height="38" width="190"></span>. Data files for this system are acompanying every <tt>PHOEBE </tt>release and reside in <code>data/UVLeo</code> directory. There are two photometric light curves<a name="tex2html6" href="#foot77"><sup><span class="arabic">3</span></sup></a> in B and V filters (both from Bessel 1990 series): <code>UVLeo.B</code> and <code>UVLeo.V</code> and two radial velocity curves<a name="tex2html7" href="#foot78"><sup><span class="arabic">4</span></sup></a>: <code>UVLeo.rv1</code> and <code>UVLeo.rv2</code> - one for each star.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00034000000000000000">
Supplying experimental data</a>
</h2>

<p>
First and foremost, we have to tell <tt>PHOEBE </tt>where to find our experimental data.

</p><p>
On top of the <code>Data</code> tab (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_data_tab">4</a>) you may see a <code>Star Name</code> entry field. This field is for your convenience only and carries no modeling significance. Click on it and enter <code>UV Leonis</code>. Note that the main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window title has changed accordingly.

</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_data_tab"></a><a name="84"></a>
<table>
<caption align="bottom"><strong>Figure 4:</strong>
<tt>PHOEBE </tt>data tab.</caption>
<tbody><tr><td>
<div align="center">
<img src="phoebe_data_tab.png" alt="phoebe_data_tab" align="bottom" border="0">
<br>
</div></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>Now we shall face our first physical decision: we must assign a
model to our star by choosing the most appropriate from the given
choices (the <code>Model</code>
field). The choice of a model is very important, since it poses
additional constraints on our solution. Take a minute to browse through
available models, but since our star in fact is a detached system,
leave it on default<a name="tex2html9" href="#foot88"><sup><span class="arabic">5</span></sup></a>.

</p><p>
Next, we will supply <tt>PHOEBE </tt>with two light curves and two radial velocity curves; enter the number 2 in fields labelled <code>Light Curves</code> and <code>RV Curves</code>.
You may change these values directly, by clicking on the entry and
typing 2 instead of 0, or use the arrows next to the entry. As you
change the number of experimental data curves, empty records are added
to light curves list and to radial velocity curves list. Note that the
used abreviation for light curves is <code>LC</code> and for radial velocity curves is <code>RV</code>.
A major break-through will be accomplished by implementing complete
spectra as experimental input data and this is planned for the
intermediate future.
</p><p>
Assign the first light curve to <tt>PHOEBE</tt>. Edit the first LC data entry by either double-clicking on it, or by clicking on the <code>Edit Data Entry</code> button on the lower right part of the list while that entry is highlighted. An assignment window (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_assign_lc_record">5</a>) will appear.

</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_assign_lc_record"></a><a name="93"></a>

</div>

<p>
Input files should contain two or three columns. The first column contains the <b>independent</b> variable, which may be either <span class="textit">phase</span> or <span class="textit">heliocentric Julian date (HJD)</span>. The second column contains the <b>dependent</b> variable, which may be in <span class="textit">flux</span> or <span class="textit">magnitude</span> units. The third column is optional; if present, it contains individual weights given either as <span class="textit">weights</span> or as <span class="textit">standard deviation</span>. The normalization is arbitrary; higher the number, stronger the weight.

</p><p>
Now inspect your input files from the terminal; simply write something like<a name="tex2html11" href="#foot105"><sup><span class="arabic">6</span></sup></a>:

</p><p>

</p><pre>   [andrej@gemma andrej]$ head phoebe/data/UVLeo/UVLeo.B
   # UV Leo Bessell B
   # Data from the Crni Vrh Observatory, Slovenia
   #
   # Standard star T0845-00073 used to measure nightly sigma.
   # Weights calculated as 1/sigma^2, renormalized to [0.1, 9.9].

   [andrej@gemma andrej]$
</pre>
Immediately you see that a <code>#</code> delimeter is used for commenting; whenever <tt>PHOEBE </tt>reaches
it, the rest of the line is discarded. It is common practice to put a
small header (such as the one you see above) to your input files.
Spaces, tabs and empty lines in input files are allowed.
<p>
In our case the independent variable is heliocentric Julian date (<code>HJD</code>, <tt>PHOEBE </tt>refers to it simply as <code>Time</code>)
and the dependent variable is magnitude. The third column contains
individual weights. These weights are usually based on some sound
time-dependent insight, such as nightly variation of a standard
deviation <span class="MATH"><img src="img11.png" alt="$\sigma$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="16"></span> of a comparison star. If these <span class="MATH"><img src="img11.png" alt="$\sigma$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="16"></span>s are to be trusted, the weights are transformed as <span class="MATH"><img src="img12.png" alt="$1/\sigma^2$" align="middle" border="0" height="39" width="42"></span>. Higher the weight, stronger is the influence of a specific data point on the solution.

</p><p>
Now that we know about the input file structure, set all three column
definitions accordingly. Assign a filename by clicking on the <code>Browse</code> button and selecting <code>UVLeo.B</code> from the <code>data/UVLeo</code> directory.

</p><p>
The dispersion (standard deviation) of our data is changing from night
to night, which we already compensate with individual weighting. Thus a
simple average over all nights is a good initial approximation. Set <code>Sigma</code> to 0.026. We shall correct this approximation when the time comes, during the course of solution seeking.

</p><p>
Finally, choose apropriate filter: click on the filter button and select <code>440nm (B)</code> from the <code>Bessell</code> subgroup.

</p><p>
If you wish, <tt>PHOEBE </tt>may compensate automatically for the reddening effect given that the reddening correlation parameter <span class="MATH"><img src="img13.png" alt="$R$" align="bottom" border="0" height="16" width="19"></span> and the color excess E(B-V) are known. The measured magnitude decreases due to interstellar extinction by a factor <!-- MATH
 $A_\lambda = 0.68 \, R \, \textrm{E(B-V)} (1/\lambda \mathrm{[\mu m]} - 0.35)$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img src="img14.png" alt="$A_\lambda = 0.68 \, R \, \textrm{E(B-V)} (1/\lambda \mathrm{[\mu m]} - 0.35)$" align="middle" border="0" height="37" width="305"></span>. We consider <code>UV Leo</code>'s reddening effect to be negligible, so leave the reddening option off.

</p><p>
When you are content with the settings, click the <code>OK</code>
button. This will close the assignment window and update the list of
light curves. Repeat the above assignment for the other light curve
file; this time set the filter to <code>550nm (V)</code> from the <code>Bessell</code> subgroup and <code>Sigma</code> to 0.016.

</p><p>
All internal calculations in <tt>PHOEBE </tt>are performed in fluxes, not magnitudes. Therefore <tt>PHOEBE </tt>automatically
transforms magnitudes to fluxes, if magnitudes are dependent variables,
which in our case they are. The conversion is done by using the
user-supplied zero magnitude (the <code>Zero</code> <code>Magnitude</code> <code>for</code> <code>Flux</code> <code>Normalization</code>
option). If the zero magnitude corresponds to the magnitude at quarter
phase, then the flux will be normalized at quarter phase. This is what
the user should tend to, but not rigorously. By this we mean the
following: don't spend your time seeking the right zero magnitude,
leave this to <tt>PHOEBE</tt>. Just be sure you are close enough: <span class="MATH"><img src="img15.png" alt="$\pm$" align="middle" border="0" height="33" width="20"></span> 2 magnitudes or so. In our case leaving zero magnitude at 10.0 will do just fine.

</p><p>
Next, assign radial velocity curves to <tt>PHOEBE</tt>. In much the same manner as above, inspect the contents of a radial velocity file:
</p><pre>   [andrej@gemma andrej]$ head phoebe/data/UVLeo/UVLeo.rv1
   # UV Leo Primary Star Radial Velocities
   # Data from the Asiago Observatory, Italy
   #
   # All data reduced with IRAF from acquired Echelle spectra
   #
   #    HJD          RV
   2451209.51624  -151.4
   2451210.43364   166.6
   2451216.49289   116.0
   2451217.46653    18.9
   [andrej@gemma andrej]$
</pre>
Independent variable for radial velocities is much the same as for
light curves: either phase or HJD. The dependent variable is different;
it is a measure of radial velocities, which is given either in <code>km/s</code> or in <code>100km/s</code>. The latter is a <code>WD</code> legacy, because numerous input files from the past had these units as input. You are thus advised to use <code>km/s</code> if possible, because <tt>PHOEBE </tt>does all the renormalization internally. Weighting is done in exactly the same manner as for light curves.

<p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_assign_rv_record"></a><a name="115"></a>

</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>
From inspecting the radial velocities experimental data, we conclude that the independent variable is <code>Time</code> and that the dependent variable is radial velocity in <code>km/s</code>. This time the weights are missing, so the third column of an input file should be set to <code>Unavailable</code>. Set both <code>Sigma</code>s to 10 km/s (the initial approximation) and choose a filter <code>861nm (RVIJ)</code> from <code>RV filters</code>
subgroup. Radial velocities should theoretically be independent of the
filter choice and in most cases they are; this specific filter tells <tt>PHOEBE </tt>to use a straight flux file and not think of radial velocities as wavelength dependent values.

</p><p>
After assigning a second radial velocity curve, note that filter names
in RV columned list have changed: two extra numbering delimeters <code>#1</code> and <code>#2</code> have been added to make a distinction in curve dependent assignments.

</p><p>
If you want to use bins instead of complete data arrays, you may select
data binning next. This is advisable only when you deal with
considerable number of data points (5000 or more), and that only when
seeking a preliminary solution. Be aware that you are degrading light
curves heavily this way.
</p><p>
If you followed the described procedure correctly, you should end up with a <code>Data</code> tab as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_filled_data_tab">7</a>.

<p>
When we are finished with specifying experimental data for <tt>PHOEBE </tt>in the <code>Data</code> tab, let's proceed to the <code>System-related</code> tab (Fig. <a href="#phoebe_basic_tab">8</a>).

<p>
The <code>System-related</code> tab contains 8 physical parameters
that apply to the binary system as a whole (contrary to
component-related parameters, which apply to each component of the
binary system individually). They are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>HJD0</code>: the reference time epoch of the zero phase. It
is in units of HJD and it determines the initial point (the origin) for
the epoch of the binary.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>PERIOD</code>: the period of the binary. It is given in days.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>DPDT</code>: the first time derivative of the binary. It
gives the period change rate in days per day, so if different than 0,
it is a very small quantity.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>PSHIFT</code>: a constant phase shift of ephemeris time. By applying the shift 0.5, one easily exchanges the roles of both components.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>SMA</code>: the semi-major axis of the binary. It is the maximum distance between both binary components given in solar radii, <span class="MATH"><img src="img19.png" alt="$R_\odot$" align="middle" border="0" height="35" width="30"></span>.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>RM</code>: the mass ratio. It is defined as the ratio of a
secondary component mass over primary component mass, primary star
being the one <b>eclipsed</b> at phase 0.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>INCL</code>: the inclination of the system. It is measured in degrees: inclinations smaller than <span class="MATH"><img src="img20.png" alt="$90^o$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="31"></span> mean that the binary rotates counter-clockwise as projected onto a plane of sky; inclinations larger than <span class="MATH"><img src="img20.png" alt="$90^o$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="31"></span> mean that the binary rotates clockwise as projected onto a plane of sky.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><code>VGA</code>: the radial velocity of the binary system center of mass expressed in km/s.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
First four parameters, <tt>HJD0</tt>, <tt>PERIOD</tt>, <tt>DPDT</tt> and <tt>PSHIFT</tt> are called the <b>epoch</b>
parameters, since they determine the ephemeris epoch of the binary.
With these parameters the mapping to phase-space is readily possible.
The following four parameters, <tt>SMA</tt>, <tt>RM</tt>, <tt>XINCL</tt> and <tt>VGA</tt> determine the global binary shape.

</p><p>
Let us focus for one second at parameter input form (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_parameter_entry_explained">9</a>); each parameter is given by its keyword, a concise description and a value.

</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_parameter_entry_explained"></a><a name="152"></a>

</div>

<p>
<tt>PHOEBE </tt>keyword is the symbol by which a particular parameter is identified in <tt>PHOEBE </tt>. Keyword names follow a well established WD standard, but since <tt>PHOEBE </tt>does much more, new keyword names had to be introduced. In appendix <a href="#phoebe_keywords">D</a> a complete list of all <tt>PHOEBE </tt>keywords is given. A file containing all parameter values in form <tt>KEYWORD = VALUE</tt> is called a <b>keyword file</b>. These files usually have the extension <tt>.phoebe</tt>, but there are no limitations in this respect.

</p><p>
A concise description is meant to elaborate on sometimes cryptic
parameter keywords and give additional explanation on some conventions
that are not obvious (e.g. the mass ratio being defined as the mass of
the secondary star divided by the mass of the primary star - see
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_basic_tab">8</a>).

</p><p>
The parameter value depends on parameter type. Usually the value is a number (integer or real), but it may also be boolean (<tt>TRUE</tt> and <tt>FALSE</tt>) or a string (text). A typical example of a boolean value is the adjustment switch (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#phoebe_parameter_entry_explained">9</a>), where a string value is, in example, the experimental data filter name.

</p><p>
The <tt>Adjust</tt> switch is used to mark the parameter for
adjustment. If turned on, this switch causes the value of the
corresponding parameter to be fitted during the minimization process<a name="tex2html16" href="#foot165"><sup><span class="arabic">7</span></sup></a>. Otherwise the value is kept.

</p><p>
If the value is to be adjusted, the <b>minimization step</b> size tells <tt>PHOEBE </tt>how
crudely to change the values during the minimization process. These
values should be carefully chosen, because a value too large will skip
the minimum and the value too small will take unnecessarily long
computing time.
</p><p>Finally, on the right-most part there are parameter boundaries
for the simplex minimization routine. This routine scans through the
parametric hyperspace in search for a global minimum. This is yet to be
implemented, so all these boundaries are currently shaded out.
</p><p>

<span class="MATH"><img src="img22.png" alt="$\vdots$" align="bottom" border="0" height="27" width="10"></span></div>

<p>
Now try and change the value for period and the origin of time! Change the period to 0.600086 and <tt>HJD0</tt> to 2448500.562. These two numbers you should estimate yourself independently of using <tt>PHOEBE</tt>. Since we have no physical indications about the values of other parameters, leave them be as they are.

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00036000000000000000">
What else may we presume?</a>
</h2>

<p>
Since we know virtually nothing in advance of our star, it makes no solid sense to make <i>any</i>
further presumptions. We cannot safely say that the orbit is either
circular or elliptical, until we examine the shape of radial velocity
curves. We cannot be sure about the temperatures until we examine light
curves and measure the color index. We have no idea about the
parameters that influence the shape of synthetic curves, such as the
inclination, mass ratio or the semi-major axis; we definitely have no
clues about the secular changes (time derivatives of the period and the
periastron); these are of such perturbative order that it is rarely
obvious how to change these values. As the fit brings you closer to the
solution, more of the star's nature will be revealed; take it one step
at the time.

Inspecting data files closely</a>
</h2>

<p>
The next logical step would usually be eye inspection of light curves and radial velocity curves. <tt>PHOEBE </tt>enables you to plot experimental curves in a separate window, which you access by clicking on the <code>Plot LC</code> button on the button box for light curves and <code>Plot RV</code> button for radial velocity curves.

</p><p>
Let us start with light curves. Click on the <code>Plot LC</code> button on the button-box.

</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_lc_plotting_window"></a><a name="175"></a>
<table>
<caption align="bottom"><strong>Figure 10:</strong>
The light curves plotting window.</caption>

<div align="center">
<img src="phoebe_lc_plotting_window.png" alt="phoebe_lc_plotting_window" align="bottom" border="0">
<br>
</div></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>
The top left part of the LC plotting window (Fig. <a href="#phoebe_lc_plotting_window">10</a>)
is used to select what it is we want plotted. Synthetic light curves
are computed from theory, based on the current palette of physical
parameters. Experimental light curves are taken from our input files.
You may choose which experimental curve to plot by selecting its
photometric filter; all <tt>PHOEBE </tt>operations are in fact identified with their filter names rather than filenames.

</p><p>
The resolution of a synthetic light curve is defined by the number of
vertexes that we use for plotting. This value is held by an entry
labelled <code>Vertexes</code>.
If we have steep and narrow eclipses, we need finer resolution,
especially in eclipse regions. The number of vertexes defaults to 100,
but sometimes this does not suffice for accurate inspections. Try
setting it to 300 for the time being.
</p><p>The top right part of the LC plotting window is used to assign
the variables of our plot. The independent variable is plotted on
x-axis and the dependent variable is plotted on y-axis.
</p><p>Independent variable may be time (HJD) or phase. If the
independent variable for our plot is phase and what we have in our
input files is heliocentric Julian date, then <tt>PHOEBE </tt>automatically transforms HJD to phase according to the origin of time and period that we set in the main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window. This automatic procedure transforms all data points to have phases between <span class="MATH"><img src="img24.png" alt="$-0.5$" align="middle" border="0" height="33" width="44"></span> and <span class="MATH"><img src="img25.png" alt="$0.5$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="29"></span>. Thus, if we use a plotting range wider than this, the regions outside this interval will contain no data points. That is why <tt>PHOEBE </tt>allows you to <i>map</i>
existing points to the whole region of the plot. This means that a
single data point will occur multiple times, wherever the phase of that
point is the same. This procedure is referred to as <i>aliasing</i><a name="tex2html18" href="#foot182"><sup><span class="arabic">8</span></sup></a>. Aliasing is turned on through a <code>Turn on data aliasing</code> switch.

</p><p>
Dependent variable is a bit tricky. It may be:

</p><ul>
<li><code>Magnitude</code>; experimental data is plotted without any
transformation if the input files contain magnitudes and is transformed
with respect to the <code>Zero Magnitude</code> value from the <code>Data</code> tab to fluxes. Synthetic data is transformed internally with respect to wavelength dependent level parameters (<code>HLA</code>s and <code>CLA</code>s).
</li>
<li><code>Total Flux</code>; this is the most significant quantity for <tt>PHOEBE</tt>.
All calculations are performed with respect to the total flux. By total
flux we mean the sum of the flux from the first star, the flux from the
second star and the (optional) third light. The units of total flux are
arbitrary and are made physically meaningful through level parameters (<code>HLA</code>s and <code>CLA</code>s),
as explained in detail in the next section. Experimental data is copied
verbatim if the input files contain fluxes and is transformed with
respect to the <code>Zero Magnitude</code> value from the <code>Data</code> tab, if they contain magnitudes.
</li>
<li><code>Primary Star Flux</code>; this is the calculated contribution
of the primary star. It has no relevant counterpart in experimental
data since you cannot isolate the mere contribution of the primary
star, so that part of the output is suppressed.
</li>
<li><code>Secondary Star Flux</code>; this is the calculated
contribution of the secondary star. This too has no relevant
counterpart in experimental data and is thus suppressed.
</li>
<li><code>Normalized flux</code>; this quantity is for your convenience only. Some <code>WD</code>
users prefer to adjust the shape of a light curve first and fix the
curve level at the very end. This approach seems a bit vague and is
deprecated in <tt>PHOEBE</tt>, but it is still available. The
normalized flux is the same as the total flux, except that it is
re-normalized to the value given by the <code>Flux Factor</code> (usually 1) at the phase given by <code>Norm. Phase</code> (usually 0.25).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's first see whether our period and the origin of time make sense;
thus we do not want to plot synthetic light curve, so turn the button <code>Synthetic LC</code> off. The data filter is already set to <code>440nm (B)</code> in the drop-down list. Note that this list contains only filters that correspond to experimental data curves as defined in the <code>Data</code> tab. Now turn the <tt>Experimental light curve</tt>
switch on. We shall plot the total flux against phase (which is the
default). The phase range lets you select what phases you want plotted.
This too we shall at this time leave at their current values.
</p><p>
To actually plot the diagram, click on the <code>Plot</code> button. The plot in Fig. <a href="#phoebe_lc_plotting_window_experimental_data">11</a> appears.

</div>

<p>You may see that the values for period and the origin of time are
pretty much what one would expect, since the minima are at phases 0.0
and 0.5 for all times.
</p><p>
Whenever you click on the <code>Plot</code> button, the plot
is displayed; underneath it you may find the number of experimental
data points, in our case 1563. The values of weighted and unweighted <span class="MATH"><img src="img11.png" alt="$\sigma$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="16"></span>s (<code>Sigma</code>)
are calculated between experimental data and synthetic light curve, so
they are not calculated now that we don't plot a synthetic lightcurve.
On the right of the plot you may see the <code>Modeling</code> <code>parameters</code>
part of the plotting window; these parameters are calculated from
synthetic light curve parameters, so again they are not displayed for
our first plot.
</p><p>
Now select the other light curve by choosing <code>550nm (V)</code> filter instead of <code>440nm (B)</code>.

</p><p>Let us check how big is the difference between the initial
synthetic light curve and experimental data! Turn on synthetic light
curve (<code>Synthetic LC</code> switch) and click on <code>Plot</code> again! You are presented with the picture as it Fig. <a href="#phoebe_lc_plotting_window_both_data">12</a>.

Synthetic curve is denoted with a solid red line and experimental data with blue filled circles.

</p><p>
As you may see, the result is disasterous. Standard deviations <span class="MATH"><img src="img11.png" alt="$\sigma$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="16"></span> are now calculated. If individual weights are included in the computation, we obtain the value of <!-- MATH

 -->
<span class="MATH"><img src="img28.png" alt="$\sigma_W = 0.288071$" align="middle" border="0" height="33" width="127"></span> and if they are not included in the computation, we obtain <!-- MATH

 -->
<span class="MATH"><img src="img29.png" alt="$\sigma = 0.272182$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="112"></span>. It is <span class="MATH"><img src="img30.png" alt="$\sigma_W$" align="middle" border="0" height="33" width="31"></span> that drives our fit during the minimization scheme, more precisely a convolution of all lightcurve-dependent <span class="MATH"><img src="img30.png" alt="$\sigma_W$" align="middle" border="0" height="33" width="31"></span>s.

</p><p>
Synthetic light curve computation now supplies values to the <code>Modeling</code> <code>Parameters</code> window (on the right of the plot itself). Browse through parameters to see what is contained in the output. Abreviations <code>P</code> and <code>S</code>
stand for primary and secondary star, respectively. The masses are
expressed in units of solar mass, mean radii in units of solar radius.
Bolometric magnitude <code>Mbol</code> is in magnitude units and surface gravity potential has standard cgs units g cm/s<span class="MATH"><img src="img31.png" alt="${}^2$" align="bottom" border="0" height="20" width="12"></span>. <code>PSB</code> stands for polar surface brightness, <code>Surface</code>
is in units of the Roche lobe surface size and all radii informations
are given with respect to the semi-major axis. The values you see make
no sense, but this is of course to be expected, since parameter values
are way wrong. Don't worry about it, they will converge eventually.
</p><p>The fit between experimental points and the synthetic curve is,
for the lack of a better word, terrible. Inspect the other light curve.
To get the feeling of discrepancy, you may use the <code>Plot</code> <code>Residuals</code> switch in the mid-upper part of the window. This switch tells <tt>PHOEBE </tt>to
calculate the residuals between synthetic and experimental light curve
and to plot them against independent variable. One would hope to get a
pure scatter around 0, but this of course cannot yet be the case.
</p><p>Just above the plot there are plot control arrows and zooming
buttons. These controls enable you to move your plot according to your
needs. Try zooming in on the eclipse minimum, move the plot around and,
all in all, get a feeling of the plotting window as a whole. A button
in between the direction arrows is the reset button; clicking on it
will restore original plot settings. On the far right of that part of
the plotting window you see the grid options and the coordinate options
for your plot. The grid (both coarse and fine) is used to easily read
out the values from the plot directly. Some users might prefer axes to
a boxed coordinate system and this option is supported too.
</p><p>
When you had your share of playing with the LC plotting window and have examined the results, click on the <code>Done</code>
button to close the window. Note that you may keep the window open if
you prefer - this is usually sound to do when your monitor resolution
is very high (1600<span class="MATH"><img src="img32.png" alt="$\times$" align="middle" border="0" height="33" width="20"></span>1200 or so).

<p>
The shape and feel of the RV plotting window is much the same as the LC
plotting window, although few differences should be stressed. Dependent
plot variables are as follows:
</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li><code>Primary (Secondary) RV in km/s</code>; these two variables tell <tt>PHOEBE </tt>we want our radial velocities in km/s. This is the most common choice.
</li>
<li><code>Both RVs in km/s</code>; same as above, just that both radial velocity curves are plotted on one plot.
</li>
<li><code>Primary (Secondary) Normalized RV</code>; radial velocity
curves normalized to orbit, meaning they are transformed to a
dimensionless value by multiplying their value in km/s with<!-- MATH

 -->
 <span class="MATH"><img src="img34.png" alt="$P_0[\mathrm{s}]/2\pi a[\mathrm{km}]$" align="middle" border="0" height="37" width="118"></span>. Same is done with experimental data.

<li><code>Primary (Secondary) eclipse proximity corrections</code>;
this shows the effects of the eclipse proximity correction on radial
velocities in the same dimensionless units as explained above.

Feel free to examine other options of the plotting window. See what is
accomplished when different choices are made. Move the plot around,
turn the grid on and off, change the coordinate system shape to axes or

As you have seen, it doesn't make much sense to plot synthetic solution
over experimental data at first. The fit is of course bad and the only
thing you should really check at this early stage is that ephemerides
for your binary are correct: the period (<span class="MATH"><img src="img37.png" alt="$P_0$" align="middle" border="0" height="35" width="25"></span>) and the the origin of time (<!-- MATH
 $\mathrm{HJD}_0$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img src="img38.png" alt="$\mathrm{HJD}_0$" align="middle" border="0" height="35" width="50"></span>). If your binary exhibits a period change (typically seen by smearing you cannot fix by changing <span class="MATH"><img src="img37.png" alt="$P_0$" align="middle" border="0" height="35" width="25"></span> or <!-- MATH
 $\mathrm{HJD}_0$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img src="img38.png" alt="$\mathrm{HJD}_0$" align="middle" border="0" height="35" width="50"></span>), you should set that parameter value appropriately.

<code>UV Leonis</code> is a detached binary system and as such we may estimate the gravity potential. <tt>PHOEBE </tt>uses modified Kopal potentials as defined in (Wilson 1979). Their <code>WD</code> names are <code>PHSV</code> for a primary star and <code>PCSV</code> for a secondary star. In <code>Component-related</code> tab (Fig. <a href="#phoebe_advanced_tab">15</a>) you may find the calculation buttons next to initial parameter values. Clicking these brings out the calculation window (Fig. <a href="#phoebe_phsv_calculation">16</a>).

<p>You may quickly calculate the value of the potential by supplying
the instantaneous separation between both stars, normalized to the
semi-major axis (thus always 1.0 for circular orbits), the mass ratio
and the radius-vector to the desired point in space, again in units of
semi-major axis. To calculate the modified Kopal potential, set this
radius-vector to the star radius towards the companion star (if tidal
forces are strong, the star is deformed into a dumbell shape, so
stellar radius is direction-dependent). In case of elliptical orbit the
potential will depend on synchronicity parameter and direction cosines,
but this is out of scope of this tutorial. Please refer to <tt>PHOEBE </tt>Reference Manual for further assistance.

</p><p>
On the lowermost part of the calculation window there is a button box. The <code>Calculate</code> button calculates the value of potential. <tt>PHOEBE </tt>lets
the user inspect it and decide whether the calculated value is
acceptable or not. If not, you may close the calculation window by
clicking on the <code>OK</code> button and there will have been no changes made. If so, clicking on the <code>Update</code> button will copy the calculated value to the main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window.

</p><p>
<code>UV Leonis</code> seems to have a pretty circular orbit and in the
first approximation it seems that the default values in the calculation
window are as might be expected (we will be proven wrong shortly, but
this in fact is the realistic presumption). Therefore click on the <code>Calculate</code> button. The value 11.00504 will show up in <code>PHSV</code> entry. Since we are happy with it, click on <code>Update</code> button. The value will be copied to the <code>Advanced</code> tab of the main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window. Close the calculation window by clicking on the <code>OK</code> button.

</p><p>
Repeat the same procedure for the secondary potential. The value will be the same.

</p><p>
At this time we cannot safely presume anything about the values of
gravity brightening, albedo and synchronicity parameters, so we
continue without modifying anything.

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000">
First steps of fitting</a>
</h1>

<p>There is a preferable order of which parameters should be fitted
when. Patience is advisory; as you gain experience, you will get the
feeling of how to approach to certain types of problems. But the usual
recipe would be this: start with luminosities. These quantities,
although carrying physical name, are actually "normalizers" of your
experimental data; original minimization routines work with fluxes, not
with magnitudes, so <tt>PHOEBE </tt>internally does all the necessary conversions. These conversions are based on the normalizing magnitude that is set in the <code>Data</code>
tab. It defaults to 10, but should be set to the magnitude of the
quarter phase; as this cannot (and shouldn't) be done too accurately,
luminosities jump in and normalize the data so that the normalization
is actually done internally and you don't have to worry about it. These
luminosities are referred to as <code>HLA</code> and <code>CLA</code> in in <code>WD</code>.

</p><p>
Go to the <code>Luminosities</code> tab (Fig. <a href="#phoebe_luminosities_tab">17</a>) and turn on the <code>Adjust HLAs</code> switch. Leave the step as it is, since we are going to use Levenberg-Marquardt's <span class="MATH"><img src="img41.png" alt="$\lambda$" align="bottom" border="0" height="20" width="16"></span> multiplicator routine, which automatically chooses a proper step size when close to the solution.

<p>
Now go to the <code>Fitting</code> tab (Fig. <a href="#phoebe_fitting_tab">18</a>);
the upper part of the tab is dedicated to the method of multiple
subsets, which we will not use in this tutorial. The lower left part
belongs to the two-dimensional projection of the parameter phase-space,
which helps us analyse parameter correlations. We shall demonstrate its
use in the course of this tutorial. On the right, there are fitting
parameters, which are generally a good choice. Change grid sizes only
if stellar shapes deviate significantly from spheroids, change
Marquardt's <span class="MATH"><img src="img41.png" alt="$\lambda$" align="bottom" border="0" height="20" width="16"></span>
only if convergence isn't satisfactory. Choosing symmetrical
derivatives is a better approximation, but at the expence of computing
time. Since the time isn't that important at the moment, turn on
symmetrical derivatives! After you have gotten yourself comfortable,
click on the <code>Fit Parameters Set For Adjustment</code> switch!

<p>
After you have clicked on that button, a fitting window (Fig. <a href="#phoebe_dc_corrections">19</a>)
will show up. This window is composed of three lists that contain
important information for monitoring the progress of your soulution
trough iterations.

</div></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>On the top of the fitting window is a columned list that contains
all parameters selected for adjustment. In case of curve-independent
parameters there is only one entry and in case of curve-dependent
parameters there are as many entries as there are affected curves.
Light curves and radial velocity curves differ in this respect and have
each their own adjustment switches.
</p><p>
Parameter names are followed by their current values. The fitting algorithm will calculate the correction of <b>one</b>
iteration. Be very careful about these values, for they are the best
marker to show if the fit converges or diverges. Luminosities
essentially always converge, but you can never be too sure. This list
also shows the corrected value and standard deviation of the fit of the
particular parameter.
</p><p>
Next is a list of all experimantal curves detailing the number of points and the <span class="MATH"><img src="img44.png" alt="$\chi^2$" align="middle" border="0" height="39" width="24"></span> values before and after calculation for each curve. The <span class="MATH"><img src="img44.png" alt="$\chi^2$" align="middle" border="0" height="39" width="24"></span>
values change after each iteration to reflect the similarity of the
newly calculated curves to experimental data, and thus are another way
to monitor the convergence of your soulution.
</p><p>Finally, in the lower part of the fitting window there is a
list of passband luminosities for the primary and secondary stars, as
well as for the <span class="MATH"><img src="img45.png" alt="$3^\mathrm{rd}$" align="bottom" border="0" height="19" width="28"></span> body.

</p><p>
Now click on the <code>Calculate</code> button! After some seconds of calculating (depending on the speed of your computer), the window as in Fig. <a href="#phoebe_fitting_window">20</a> will show up.

</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><a name="phoebe_fitting_window"></a><a name="274"></a>

<p>
You may see that both corrections (and their corrected values) are in
agreement with what we expect (recall what offsets we saw in plotting
windows). Since we are happy with the fit results, we want to keep
them. So click on <code>Update all corrections</code> button to replace the original values in both the fitting window and in the main <tt>PHOEBE </tt>window with corrected values. The fitting function is now ready for the second iteration, so click on <code>Calculate</code>
button again! The corrections will now be even smaller and the
convergence obvious. Update the corrected values and recalculate the
values as many times as you see fit. As long as you are far away from
the solution, be sure to let the values converge on a decimal or two,
but as the fit gets better and better, try to be as accurate as
possible. If you persisted completely through the convergence, you
should have come up with these values:

<p>
Before you close the fitting window, take notice of the <code>Show QuickBar</code>
button. It opens a window where you can mark any system parameter for
adjustment and change its adjustment step. This is a time-saving
shortcut worth of keeping in mind.
</p><p>
When you've finished (and are happy) with fitting, close the window by clicking on the <code>Close</code> button. Go to the <code>Luminosities</code> tab (or enter the <code>Fitting QuickBar</code>),
turn off the adjustment switch of the luminosities and inspect the
results, as you have before, for both light curves. Notice any
difference? Still not perfect, but much better.
</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00050000000000000000">
I feel comfortable, what next?</a>
</h1>

<p>What's next basically depends on your particular problem. In our
case, it seems that the shape of the light curve is way off. The
parameters which influence the light curve shape the most are Kopal
potentials, so let us try and fit those. Go to the <code>System-related</code> tab and mark both primary and secondary star potentials (<code>PHSV</code>, <code>PCSV</code>) to be adjusted. Go to the <code>Fitting</code>
tab and do as before: correct the values of potentials one step at the
time. Note that the convergence is slower than for the luminosities,
but be patient and keep going until you have reached satisfactory
values. A piece of advice: keep a plotting window open and inspect what
each iteration does to your synthetic light curve!

<p>If you have followed the above scheme, you should have landed with
the primary and secondary potential values of 4.878 and 4.686,
respectively. We now see how way off we have been with our calculated
values. You may play with the values in the potential calculation
window to see what presumption was wrong. The corrected values produce
the following for both light curves:
