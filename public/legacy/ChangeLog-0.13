PHOEBE Project ChangeLog:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2002-09-19: - Fitting QuickBar connected to all main switches and values. It
              is now completely usable.
            - Mass ratio description changed -> secondary over primary part
              deleted because it was confusing to connect it to appreciated
              definition (secondary is *always* smaller than the primary).
              This was suggested by Panos Niarcos.
            - THE keyword for X-Ray binaries has been added to constraints
              handler. The entry is now disabled for other models.
            - More work on PHOEBE Homepage has been done.
            - Top-level files WISDOM, CAVEATS and QUESTIONS have been dele-
              ted, because their contents were obsolete.
            - A nice "under construction" xpm icon added to Orbit tab. :)
              This is the beginning of introducing small icons to PHOEBE
              buttons. This will hopefully be even more pleasent for the
              everyday user.
            - A lot of CVS repository directory cleaning has been done: the
              documentation was completely separated from phoebe source di-
              rectory, icons and pixmaps have been distinguished (icons are
              only those pixmaps which (will) appear on buttons and pixmaps
              in general are empty LC/RV/Chi2 plots and logos), all contri-
              butive files have been removed from the CVS. The data under
              the CVS is only for UV Leonis (along with basic parameters)
              and V505 Per (without any keyword file).
            - PHOEBE-0.13 testing version released.
2002-09-18: - Top-level README file SETTING UP section extended to include
              instructions for adding PHOEBE-related devices to SuperMongo's
              graphcap.local. Thanks to Frederic Royer for reminding me!
2002-09-17: - PHOEBE Homepage has been created. It is not completely fini-
              shed yet, but it is already functional and at present it re-
              sides on http://www.fiz.uni-lj.si/~prsa/phoebe.
2002-09-15: - Returned from the Monte Rosa GAIA conference. I have met Mr
              Wilson, Mr Van Hamme and Mr Milone, basically the alpha and
              omega of the eclipsing binaries world!!!
            - Fixed an OB1 error because of which mass ratio couldn't be
              fitted. This bug was fixed with help by Walter Van Hamme.
2002-09-05: - Added "tinygif" plotting device; it is useful for creating
              small animated gifs. Its size is 256x128 pixels.
2002-09-04: - PHOEBE Scripter window created. A button added to a Fitting
              tab that initiates the scripter. Scripter routines remain to
              be written.
2002-09-03: - Function prototypes that set widgets' sensitivity based on a
              solution constraints implemented. Constraining works for de-
              tached binaries and overcontact binaries.
            - IPB switch now also influences the sensitivity of CLA-depen-
              dent widgets. This tells the user when to expect CLAs to be
              computed from temperature (widgets are off) and when to be
              adjusted by user (widgets are on).
            - RV readout handling fixed. It should now be immune to arbit-
              rary comments within an .lco file.
            - Comments in .lco files rerouted to screen as notice windows.
              There are currently 4 supported notices (critical lobe and
              critical potential) and only one ever encountered! :)
2002-09-02: - WD98 .lco file obviously has only *more or less* standard sha-
              pe! Thus in some cases WD inserts a comment in a file (e.g.
              that the secondary star overfills the critical Roche lobe),
              which alters all positions of parameters in a file. Therefore
              PHOEBE crashed when such an unexpected comment was encountered
              during the readout. The whole concept of reading in values had
              to be changed. It has been done for LCs and remains to be done
              for RVs.
2002-09-01: - Cousins R and I filters added to the filter list.
2002-08-30: - A remnant of older versions which limited LCs to 5 fixed; now
              the top limit is set to 15 (Wilson 1998).
            - Drastic changes made to the filter list. Descriptive lines
              introduced for each filter set (Johnson, Stroemgren, Hippar-
              cos, RV and GAIA). Some wavelengths were catastrophically
              wrong! Fixed. It might be worth considering expandable list
              of filters, such as a pop-up menu with submenues instead of
              a combo box.
            - Comments still interfered with RV plots. Fixed.
            - Zillion new stars added to the data directory; they won't be
              put under the CVS, though, because although great, these data
              files bring nothing new, they just add to the bandpass amount
              and will be available for optional download from the PHOEBE
              homepage.
2002-08-29: - Data aliasing completed for phases (both LCs and RVs). The
              aliasing switch in both plotting windows initially turned on
              (there is no obvious reason why the user wouldn't want to
              use aliasing).
            - "Update Selection" button in the DC window disabled, because
              this option won't be implemented for quite some time (at
              least until much more pressing issues remain).
            - A Fitting QuickBar window created. Users have expressed the
              wish that adjustment switches and steps be gathered in an
              auxilliary window for faster access (so one doesn't have to
              browse through main PHOEBE tabs). The "Show QuickBar" button
              has been added to DC window. Callbacks haven't yet been con-
              nected to the DC window, so the QuickBar isn't functional
              yet.
            - Commenting supported in input data files. If a line in a data
              file contains '#', that line will be *completely* disregar-
              ded, wherever '#' is placed within that line. This could be
              improved in future so that PHOEBE disregards only the remain-
              der of the line, but that would mean too much work right now.
2002-08-28: - Chi2 3D plot wasn't working with orbital eccentricity. Fixed.
            - Two decimal numbers in Chi2 3D plot limits wasn't enough. It
              has been increased to 3. It would be useful to add automatic
              ranging in future, but it is a long-term plan.
            - PERR0 description changed. PERR0 value follows a strange
              convention where PERR0 = 0 and PERR0 = pi means that the
              elipse is oriented along the semi-minor axis.
            - A new callback added to all Adjust switches which updates
              the contents of the fitting window if these switches are
              toggled.
            - A bug fixed where original temperature values changed the
              units from K to 10000K. Now they are always in K.
            - Allocation in DCO readout wasn't correct for curve dependent
              parameters. This crashed PHOEBE when more than one such pa-
              rameters was to be adjusted. Fixed.
            - HJD -> phase transformation was off by 1 if HDJ0 was larger
              than HJD. Fixed.
            - Aliasing function implemented. GUI still has to be updated.
2002-08-27: - A new typedef "PHOEBE_dco_record" created. It holds all DCO
              quantities. It is associated with the "read_in_dco_values"
              function.
            - PERR0 units are radians. The range of PERR0 was [0, 100] and
              was obviously completely wrong. It is now set to [0, 2\pi].
            - Chi2 info list created in DC window. It contains a sum of
              squares for each data curve including only individual weig-
              hts (supplied by the user). The list has been completely
              integrated into normal operation.
            - GAIA filter wavelengths (Munari 1998) added to filter list.
            - LC/RV plotting parameters' updating is enhanced. There is no
              need to re-click on the Data switch to reread their values.
            - Systemic velocity step reduced from 1 (initially meant only
              for km/s) to 0.01 (to conform with 100km/s too).
            - PHOEBE documentation directory phoebe/doc put under a sepa-
              rate CVS. This way the user doesn't have to download the
              documentation if he doesn't want to.
            - Van Hamme limb darkening tables (along with an auxilliary
              PHOEBE file) added to the CVS directory catalogs/ld. This
              way the user may, if he so desires, download the tables
              independently from PHOEBE.
            - Instructions for obtaining PHOEBE from the CVS added to the
              top-level README file.
2002-08-26: - After 20 days of brain-dead activities and outmost leisure I
              have returned from a wonderful Montenegrian Sun. I can't say
              I'm too happy about that but I did relax and now I hope that
              PHOEBE will grow even smoother!
            - A lot of useful comments recieved from TOmaz and Paola!
              Thanks, guys!
            - VGA entry added to PHOEBE_wl_dependent_parameters structure.
            - A bug fixed in RV window: the VGA value wasn't updated when
              experimental data was selected. It now works.
            - Proximity effect switch (ICOR) split to two switches, each
              for one RV curve (ICOR1 and ICOR2). GUI updated.
2002-08-06: - Velocity units haven't been used in RV plotting. Fixed.
            - VUNIT switch moved from the Switches tab to RV plotting win-
              dow.
            - LC Plotting window slightly rearranged. The flux factor and
              magnitude base widgets are overlapping and are shown based on
              the choice of the dependent variable. Grid and box buttons
              moved more to the left. Phase normalization switch moved from
              Switches tab to here.
            - Switches tab finally deleted.
            - Well, dear reader, I am happily signing off and going to the
              Montenegrian seaside! Bye bye!
2002-08-05: - Inclination fitting diverges if the starting value is 90. Thus
              this value has been changed to 80.
            - A bug introduced when NPPL switch was deleted that caused gar-
              bage to be entered to a DCI file. Fixed.
            - Chi2 calculation for RVs was accidentally left disabled. Now
              it is back on.
            - If only experimental data is selected in plotting windows,
              synthetic curve (LC or RV) was calculated redundantly. Fixed.
            - Zooming and moving the RV plot caused garbage to be written
              as data points number. Fixed.
            - A new typedef enum PHOEBE_plot_device added to phoebe_global.
              It is passed to all plotting routines as an indicator of the
              desired output.
            - Plot to File button in LC plotting window enabled. Plotting
              devices currently supported are x11 (the screen), encapsulated
              postscript (eps), X Windows Pixmap (xpm) and columned plain
              text (ascii).
            - Prototypes for RV Plot to File functions created, but not
              connected yet.
            - A few small glitches smoothened out and unified through all
              Plot to File related routines.
            - Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) and Portable Pixmap (.ppm)
              added to device list.
            - RV Plot to File fully supported. Prototype functions made for
              chi2 plot. The Plot to File button has been added to the fit-
              ting window and callbacks generated. Chi2 plotting routine
              first has to be rewritten to use SM library. Then and only
              then Plot to File may be enabled.
2002-08-04: - All DEL-XY delimeters changed to Step, because it seemed WD98
              notation didn't help anyone, it just brought more confusion.
            - Interest combo box finally deleted. Button box was extended to
              include "Plot LC" button, "Plot RV" button and "Fitting" but-
              ton. The "Run" button was deleted along with all attached
              callback functions.
            - A parameter table in plotting windows was updated even if syn-
              thetic lightcurve wasn't plotted. Fixed.
            - A typing error Modelling -> Modeling fixed in both plotting
              windows.
            - IPB switch had an old callback dangling which crashed PHOEBE
              when the switch was turned on. Fixed.
            - The weighting "Edit Entry" button was enabled by default,
              which caused a segfault when clicked when no records were pre-
              sent. Fixed.
            - The tutorial extended significantly.
2002-08-03: - Column number spin button in the Data tab was obsolete and was
              deleted. Tutorial updated to reflect this change.
            - NPPL number spin button in the Data tab was obsolete and was
              deleted. Tutorial updated to reflect this change.
            - Tutorial heavily modified; all sorts of updates and improve-
              ments.
2002-08-02: - A bug caused a fatal PHOEBE termination if assigned data file
              didn't have any filters assigned. This was a consequence of
              non-consistent filter names checking for plotting routines.
              This bug is now fixed.
            - Another bug that changed multiple filter names has been fixed:
              if a data entry has been edited, but its filter remained un-
              changed, then an extra #2 was appended to its name. Fixed.
            - Fool-proofing added to data file format; if the format doesn't
              conform to the format defined in Data tab, experimental data
              output is suppressed.
            - Fool-proofing added to missing filenames; again, if a file-
              name is missing (invalid), PHOEBE warns the user about it
              and suppresses any further data output.
            - Corrected parameter values from fitting are now updated in
              plotting windows as well. This eliminates the work-around
              of turning off and then on the data switch in those windows.
            - A bug that resetted original values when clicked on Update
              button in the DC Corrections window, although there were
              no corrections calculated, fixed. Now nothing happens.
            - phoebe/data directory updated.
2002-08-01: - PHOEBE 0.12 released. This is the first testing version.
            - First 18 pages of PHOEBE 0.12 tutorial have been written.
2002-07-31: - Binning checked, some minor type inconsistencies fixed.
            - Code cleaning even furtherly purified PHOEBE.
            - Synthetic grid buttons have been temporarily disabled, be-
              cause of their unfinished state. They will be made available
              in the next version (or the CVS shortly).
2002-07-30: - After a long long time, RVs are working again without any ma-
              jor issues. Plotting of *both* RVs at the same time is cur-
              rently disabled, because it is very dangerous to examine both
              curves at the same time -> users don't bother to check if
              the right data belongs to the right synthetic RV curve. This
              decision will be given more thought soon.
            - A bug in filter naming (adding a #number to multiple curves
              in same filters), which added extra #number if already num-
              bered filter's record (other than the filter itself) was
              changed, is now fixed.
            - Level-dependent weighting (NOISE) added to wl_dependent type-
              def and is read in properly.
            - Fitting functions GREATLY simplified and working wonderfully.
            - Mass ratio (RM) spin-button steps were too large. Fixed.
            - An ambiguity in units of RVs fixed; fitting now *always* uses
              100km/s as units, so PHOEBE takes care of the transformation
              from km/s if necessary. That was the reason why the fitting
              of semi-major axis failed; now it works without issues. How-
              ever, mass ratio is still returning nan after fitting.
            - A FIRST EVER preliminary result reached with PHOEBE: UV Leo.
              The configuration file may be found in the data directory.
2002-07-29: - A bug in RV dependent variable keyword entries fixed.
            - A LOT of work rearranging routines has been done.
2002-07-26: - phoebe_global.h created. It will hold all global variables and
              typedefs from now on.
            - phoebe_allocations.c and phoebe_allocations.h created. All
              memory allocations, readouts, struct readins etc. go in here.
            - All global declarations moved from main.h to phoebe_global.h
              and main.h erased, Makefile.am updated.
            - phoebe_gui_typedefs.c and phoebe_gui_typedefs.h erased.
            - Memory allocation for PHOEBE_data_record types moved to
              phoebe_allocations.c. Callbacks code cleaned with this.
            - Default dependent variable in LC plot window changed from
              Magnitude to Total Flux.
            - A humongous fixing has begun; all functions now go through a
              major rework and hopefully, everything after this fix will
              be ready for the first ever major public release.
2002-07-25: - FOUND THE BUG! Again, readout_str vs. working_str violation.
            - open_keyword_file () function simplified with another readout
              function. Implementation is finished, keywords still have to
              be adopted.
            - Secondary star temperature (TAVC) had wrong units in DC fit-
              ting window. Fixed.
            - DC Update All Corrections button functional. It works for
              both plain widgets and CLists.
            - LD interpolation window got hidden when values were updated.
              This wasn't practical. The window now closes only on the
              click to the Close button.
            - Started working on SuperMongo library calls instead of ex-
              ternal calls to SuperMongo itself. Library bindings work,
              but we just lost on general portability. Autoutils should
              check if these libs are available and if not, compile it
              without SM support. If nothing else, ./configure must fail
              if these libraries are missing.
2002-07-24: - Seeking a bug that crashes PHOEBE while opening keyword file
              on some machines (not including mine), but to no avail. Some
              small irrelevant details changed in affected routines.
2002-07-23: - A nonsense layout of X2A adjustability widget in LD tab fixed.
            - Marquardt lambda (XLAMDA) widget added. A switches typedef
              has been extended to include it, also read_in_switches ()
              function reads it in as well. DCI creation routine has been
              updated accordingly.
            - Fitting parameters layout in Fitting tab changed.
            - All "Adjustable" switches renamed to "Adjust" for obvious
              reasons. Widget names have also been changed from _adjustable
              to _adjust.
            - Model combo box contents changed to be more user-friendly.
            - A warning window, although created, didn't show up on the
              screen in some circumstances. Fixed.
2002-07-22: - Chi2 calculation button was not fool-proof against undefined
              filter, which caused PHOEBE to crash. Fixed.
            - main.c cleared; it now contains only init functions.
            - An overflow bug in version number string fixed.
            - MODE combo box moved from Switches to Data tab. Also, Name
              entry for star name has been created. It has no significant
              purpose other than easier paperwork.
            - N1 and N2 separated and moved from Switches tab to Fitting
              tab. Same has been done for N1L and N2L.
            - ISYM switch (symetrical derivatives) moved to Fitting tab.
            - Fool-proofing added to environment readout; PHOEBE scans the
              environment to find the HOME entry. If it fails, it prompts
              the user to define it and restart PHOEBE. $HOME is definitely
              a must-have on Linux, so this doesn't seem too harsh.
2002-07-19: - Some minor glitches of already existent CLists fixed.
            - Limb Darkening Coefficients for RVs CListed.
            - Level-dependent weighting CListed. This is the last LC/RV num-
              ber dependent quantity, so hopefully we're through with chan-
              ging the interface. Now routines will be optimized for as
              many LCs and RVs as the user wants (actually, the current LC
              limitation posed by WD98 is 25) and soon a new release will be
              made.
            - Finally, the doubling, tripling, ... of LC and/or RV curve
              filters is handled correctly. To each filter name there is a
              #number appended to separate one curve from another. It is
              done in only one routine, which changes PHOEBE_*_data accor-
              dingly. This means that all other functions that depend on
              filters *must* read only PHOEBE_*_data[i].filter names.
            - LD interpolation routine fixed to reflect the above change.
2002-07-18: - 3rd light CListed.
            - LC plotting turned off because of extensive changes in main
              PHOEBE window.
            - SPECS file enhanced with What Goes Where section and Widgets
              Naming Convention section.
            - phoebe_init () function created to lighten the load of main().
            - Further code cleaning has been done.
            - Limb Darkening Coefficients CListed. Interpolation routines
              fixed accordingly.
2002-07-17: - RV lists incorporated onto their designated places in Data and
              Luminosities tabs. RV plotting is still turned off at the mo-
              ment and will remain so until integration is complete.
            - Keyword entries precision changed from single to double.
            - Serious code cleaning done.
            - Defaults main button activated.
2002-07-16: - A small bug fixed: PHOEBE segfaulted when double-clicked on
              the empty CList record. Checking is now incorporated every-
              where.
2002-07-15: - Theory of fields PASSED!!! :)
2002-07-09: - Zero magnitude spin button added to Data tab. This is not to
              be confused with MZERO value of WD98. This is a value of mag-
              nitudes which is used to transform magnitude-given input fi-
              les to fluxes. One should set this value (from now on reffer-
              red to as MNORM) to have the flux in quarter phase after
              transformation around unity and then adjust luminosities to
              fit the exact values of normalization.
            - Synthetic grid changed: previously it was arranged filter
              after filter, which isn't really practical for reading out
              the values. This is why it has been changed to sort the grid
              by filters last, meaning different filters for same parameter
              values are together.
2002-07-08: - LC luminosities have been CListed and placed from Utilities
              to Luminosities tab. Same has to be done for RVs.
2002-07-05: - After much effort, CList for LC information has finally re-
              placed all obsolete widgets. Same has to be done for RVs.
            - Luminosities CList containers for both LCs and RVs created.
              Both CLists now reside in Utilities tab and will be moved
              to Luminosities as soon as possible.
2002-07-04: - A few fixes on observational weighting have been done.
            - Added new UV Leonis photometric data.
2002-07-03: - An upper limit for LC number set to 25, according to (Wilson
              2001, WD98, pg. 17).
            - Created a toplevel WISDOM file, which contains physical in-
              sights to PHOEBE related modeling.
            - Normalization routine estimate_zero_magnitude added to trans-
              formations. It is based on unweighted average, which is not
              the best possible choice (median would be better). However,
              input fluxes to DC are in arbitrary units (they *must* be
              fluxes and not magnitudes, though), so normalization isn't
              really important. It is the question of style, really; it is
              nice to at least tend to normalize magnitude-supplied data
              to unity at quarter phase. This remains in the TODO.
            - All normalization procedures from magnitude-based input files
              now go over estimate_zero_magnitude function. MZERO influen-
              ces *only* the LC magnitude output. FACTORed LC output is
              unnecessary and will probably dissapear soon.
            - Luminosities and limb darkening coefficients all have as many
              values as there are lightcurves. Therefore DC info list must
              contain as many entries. Done.
2002-07-02: - phoebe_warning function added to improve error handling.
            - More work on DC calculation window integration has been done.
            - Further file-list integration has been done. Old widgets are
              slowly being deleted.
            - Luminosity spin button limitations fixed; the upper limit was
              4\pi, now it's 100.
            - If there are no RV curves present, WD98 cannot calculate SMA,
              so the adjustment button has to be disabled. Fixed.
            - Temperature adjusting has to have changed units. Fixed.
            - Memory initialization bug that caused DC computation to crash
              when run without and RV curves fixed.
            - String allocation bug in LD typedef fixed.
            - Fixed a bug in DCI creation function that used the wrong va-
              lue for YBOL1.
2002-07-01: - DC calculation window created. It contains a list of all pa-
              rameters selected for adjustment with their original values.
              After the calculation all other cells are filled with read
              data from DCO file.
2002-06-30: - Added double-clicking editability of synthetic grid entries.
              Unfortunately, this demanded that the list widget remains
              active all the time, because disabling it during the editing
              also disables "event" signal propagation. The sensitivity is
              therefore kept on all the time.
            - Added double-clicking editability of lightcurve data. The
              same restrictions apply as above.
            - 2D correlations Calculate button sensitivity fixed. If clic-
              ked on that button when no lightcurves were defined, the
              program crashed. It is now fixed.
            - A DC minimization window created and adjusting parameter list
              populated. Calculation functions are already finished, all we
              yet have to do is to add individual experimental curves' sig-
              mas and write the calculated values into the list.
2002-06-28: - PHOEBE version number and date is now declared in main.c and
              main.h. Up until now the label in GLADE file had to be chan-
              ged and the whole package recompiled.
            - A small header created for grid files.
            - Grid-related source files phoebe_grid.c and phoebe_grid.h
              introduced and all relevant functions and callbacks moved
              there.
2002-06-25: - Keyword file saving/opening now works for both old and new
              LC declaration widgets. Old parts have been marked for dele-
              tion.
            - RV columned list has been added to Utilities window. Every-
              thing is the same as for LC columned list, it just needs to
              to be finished. The question is, of course, what is the mea-
              ning of more than 2 RV curves.
            - Synthetic grid calculator didn't refresh the list on conse-
              cutive button-clicks. Fixed.
            - Editing synthetic LC grid parameters is now possible; there
              is a special window dedicated to that.
            - Finally, grid calculation is about finished. Everything else
              (including defining different grid parameters) will be done
              in one of next releases.
2002-06-24: - Dialog windows have been destroyed if one would close them by
              pressing the (x) button on the window decoration. This beha-
              vior was wrong; the window should only be hidden. Fixed.
            - The effort to bring more LCs to PHOEBE has paid off during the
              past few days; with a lot of testing and learning, PHOEBE is
              finally capable of handling infinite light~ and radial velo-
              city curves. Currently there is a columned list in Utilities
              tab and it will remain so until everything works without any
              issues. Keyword file saving has been modified already to re-
              flect this change.
            - Unfortunately, explained development has pushed the date of
              0.12 release for another few weeks. I hope it was worth wai-
              ting for.
2002-06-17: - Grid calculation added to Utilities tab. Window is created and
              templates have been set. Basic calculation is already availa-
              ble.
2002-06-14: - All variable names have been cleaned up for 0.12 release.
2002-06-09: - PHOEBE UNDER CVS :pserver:andrej@deneb.ago.uni-lj.si:[path]!
            - Chi2 plotting function cleaned of directory dependency; now
              all calculations are performed in PHOEBE_TEMP_DIR.
2002-06-06: - Extensive code cleaning performed.
            - DEVELOPERS text file renamed to SPECS, since it contains spe-
              cifications and suggestions for potential developers.
            - The worst bug ever discovered in PHOEBE: a humongous memory
              leak was produced by allocating, printing to and freeing
              string pointers generated by GTK. This is prohibited by GTK
              and that was the cause of earlier crashes (prior to multi-
              ple strings work-around). It is now mainly fixed (in all ma­
              jor .c sources) and it will be thoroughly checked before the
              next release.
2002-06-05: - Wavelength-dependent typedef is extended to read out RV data
              next to already implemented LC readout. This drastically sim-
              plifies RV plotting routines.
2002-06-03: - An aspectxpm entry added to SuperMongo's graphcap.local. It
              will eventually make aspectgif obsolete, which is done because
              of GIF copyright problems.
            - A small bug that prevented 3D Chi2 initial (empty) plot to
              have a proper dimension has been fixed.
            - All image formats changed to XPM instead of GIF.
            - A new spin button has been put to PHOEBE_plot_lc window:
              standard deviation. It is easier to "measure" how good the
              experimental estimate for sigma is.
            - A complete style unification has been started. At this point
              no new features will be added until the code is cleaned com-
              pletely.
            - Clean-up functionality added; prior to exiting, PHOEBE now
              deletes all the files it created in PHOEBE_TEMP_DIR directo-
              ry -> all phoebe_* files.
2002-06-02: - A small bug in file_exists function fixed; it returned errno
              handler, which is volatile and thus not appropriate for re-
              turns. The switch is now boolean and we use it like boolean:
              if (file_exists ("bla")) or if (! file_exists ("bla")). All
              functions have been updated accordingly (hopefully ;) ).
            - Finally, believe it or not, A MAJOR FIX: the consecutive fi-
              lenames for all config/run files have been numbered and no-
              thing is lost anymore! The fine-tuning will be done as soon
              as gif->xpm conversion is finished. 
2002-05-30: - Error handling for malloc, realloc and fatal events implemen-
              ted. Memory access is now called through those wrappers; this
              is not a sound policy, but for as long as memory testing goes,
              this seems to be best.
            - Chi2 2D correlation works! Well, kind of; parameters' limits
              still have to be taken from their spin buttons, a bunch of
              non-important, stylistic buttons have to be finished, but
              already a user can calculate and draw SMA vs. XINCL!
2002-05-29: - An ugly bug fixed: when calculating chi2, the values further-
              most to the right were treated as they were on the left due
              to inaccurate inequality. It is now fixed.
2002-05-27: - Independent variable switch deleted. It seems that that combo
              has no purpose, since independent variable is set from the LC
              Plotting window. The entry has also been deleted from keyword
              files.
            - Spin buttons FACTOR and MZERO were moved to LC Plotting win-
              dow. It just makes more sense for them to be there.
            - Third light and opacity support finished in LC Plotting.
            - RV Plotting Window rearranged to reflect the changes in LC
              Plotting window. It would be worth considering what are the
              benefits of separate plotting window; is it really necessary?
              Wouldn't it be more intuitive to have them integrated in the
              main PHOEBE window?
            - VGA spin button added to RV Plotting window. It seems like a
              useful variable in the plotting window itself.
            - Most of RV plotting routines have been enhanced and modified
              so to follow the example from LC plotting.
2002-05-24: - Synthetic noise support has been finished; the button has been
              moved to Luminosities tab (for correspondence with weighting)
              and keyword files hold the information on the switch state and
              the seed value. A random number generator for seed has been
              made.
            - Standard deviation for synthetic noise background label and
              spin button have been added; now hopefully synthetic noise
              makes sense.
            - Detailed reflection effect transferred to luminosities tab as
              well; keywords and read_in functions have been updated to
              reflect that change.
            - 3rd light support finished: initial values changed from 10.0
              to 0.0; wl_dependent read_in function extended to contain 3rd
              light as well.
            - Plot LC window rearranged to contain 3rd light and Opacity
              function spin buttons. They are supported formally, but fil-
              ter-dependent callbacks still have to be adjusted.
2002-05-23: - A small inconsistency fixed in callback functions: the PHSV/
              PCSV calculation routines used the separate function for
              shading regulation, which already exists generically.
            - RM and F1 values from main PHOEBE window are now transferred
              to PHSV/PCSV calculation window prior to calculation.
            - Status bar now informs the user that PHSV/PCSV calculation
              has been initiated.
            - A small bug fixed: if LC number was changed, the change didn't
              reflect in fitting and plotting combo boxes. Now it does.
2002-05-22: - Added filename parameter in create_dci_file routine. This
              eliminated the "no write privilidges" warning.
            - Deleted obsolete function variables for LCI file creation:
              IFSMV1, IFSMV2, PHNORM, THE, VUNIT, FACTOR, MZERO. They have
              already been included through typedefs. A new typedef has
              been introduced for wavelength dependent parameters.
            - Extensive code cleaning has been made around LC plotting.
            - Another nasty bug has been eliminated; due to rounding error
              in WD98 the number of synthetic points doesn't always corres-
              pond to chosen number; thus renumbering was necessary and
              now it has been done so.
            - A Chi2 plotting function has been further implemented; it
              now has a nice progress bar to ease your waiting. Also, the
              implementation triggered a heavy code change; it is now even
              more mature and I hope it now has more or less standard form.
2002-05-21: - Default setting for semi-major axis changed from 1 to 10.
            - A nasty bug fixed that caused segfault in LC plot: if binning
              was active and independent variable was set to time and expe-
              rimental data was turned on, the plot segfaulted due to bin-
              ning attempt.
2002-05-20: - Started working on DC section; a two-parameter correlation GUI
              has been created in the Fitting tab, a routine for dcout read-
              out has been prototyped.
2002-05-17: - Higher Quantum Mechanics PASSED!!! :)
2002-05-07: - LD interpolation button was active even if the LD switch in
              configuration window was off. It is now fixed.
            - MMS support finished. It is to be considered if it is impor-
              tant to save MMS settings to keyword file. Currently it seems
              unnecessary.
2002-05-06: - Preliminary support for the method of multiple subsets has
              been introduced to Fitting tab. Clicks and shades appear to
              work correctly; the DCI creation still doesn't reflect the
              implementation.
2002-05-05: - About PHOEBE window created and connected to Help menu entry.
2002-04-28: - Digits after a decimal place have been changed for temperature
              from 5 to 0, since it makes no sense to have temperatures to
              5 decimals accurate.
            - Monochromatic/bolometric buttons have been joint to only one
              interpolation button; the choice is now reflected in the se-
              parate interpolation window through a combo box.
            - All interpolation callbacks have been finished. Interpolation
              now works for bolometric and monochromatic values.
            - Log g and metallicity values added to keyword files.
2002­04-27: - LD tables readout has been changed; return value is now a
              typedefed PHOEBE_data, where .weight is used to carry error
              handler and .indep and .dep return values for x and y. The
              routine for bolometric readout is no longer necessary, for
              the new routine has been introduced that reads out data based
              on the desired filter, supplied as an argument.
            - Fixed a rounding bug in metallicity string conversion.
            - A file ld_availability.data has been created and put to LD
              shared directory; it contains triplets (T, log g, M) that
              are available in LD tables and is used for interpolation.
            - Interpolation routine has been completed and tested. There
              are potential flaws in out-of-range values, but for now just
              avoid them; it will be fixed with global error-handling.
            - Temperature spin-button limits have been changed accordingly:
              from 2000-20000 to 3500-50000 interval of allowed values.
            - A new GUI window for interpolation has been created, but only
              the GUI layout. Callbacks still have to be connected.
2002-04-21: - Error handling for LD table readout is provided through an
              integer return value: 0 for OK and -1 for failure.
2002-04-05: - Started working on limb darkening coefficients interpolation.
              Configuration window has been modified to contain LD switch
              and directory entry. Two new source files have been introdu-
              ced: phoebe_limb_darkening.c and phoebe_limb_darkening.h.
              A prototype for the interpolating function has been created.
2002-03-22: - Transformation routines have been enhanced - they now use
              typedefs instead of static variables. There was also a problem
              with FACTORing, which is now fixed.
            - All climb rates for spin buttons have been unified and set
              to zero. Values change much more smoothly now.
            - Normalization routine has been implemented for correct nor-
              malization. Up until now the "normalization" only multiplied
              the input data by FACTOR, now it actually normalizes data
              at PHNORM and then multiplies it by FACTOR. Possible problems
              exist if there are no data points close to PHNORM.
2002-03-20: - Spin-button step for XINCL changed from 0.01 to 0.1.
            - IPB and IFAT* switches have been moved to Luminosities tab.
              IPB influences whether CLAs are to be taken into account, so
              it makes more sense to have it there. Shading for CLAs has
              been fixed to reflect this switch. IFAT2 switch never existed
              and now it does.
2002-03-17: - Prototypes for fitting functions have been made.
            - A bug in DCI file creation has been fixed: due to cfortran.h
              "feature" that images C's [0,n] to FORTRAN's [1,n+1] auto-
              matically produced an OB1 error in PHOEBE code. Now it has
              been fixed and tested.
            - Due to ANSI C compatibility all GTK+ related typedefs (gint,
              gchar, ...) have been replaced by original C declarations.
              As PHOEBE progresses, it would be much better to check the
              float/double/.../ dependent accuracy from a Makefile.am and
              not by GTK+ typedefs.
            - A bug in RV plot due to inconsistency between data VUNIT and
              synthetic VUNIT has been fixed. It now works for arbitrary
              synthetic VUNIT values.
2002-03-14: - LC Binning finally fully supported. Any sense in binning RVs?
            - A serious code-cleaning has been made concerning static and
              dynamic space allocation. Hopefully everything will work
              much better now that RAM is dinamically accessed.
2002-03-11: - A bug fixed that wrote PHNORM value as integer instead of
              double into a keyword file.
2002-03-10: - Switches tab changed; it is eventually expected that this tab
              will dissapear and its entries distributed to other tabs.
2002-03-08: - Fixed-size arrays changed to dynamically allocated memory
              blocks. The source hasn't been tested for leaks yet; the main
              reason for this is to allow PHOEBE to receive as large input
              data block as limited by RAM itself. Practically this means
              that all limitations are set by the WD98, not by PHOEBE.
2002-03-05: - Weighting supported in Luminosities tab. Now you may choose
              between three different weighting options.
2002-03-04: - Adjustable toggle buttons for LD coefficients have been
              fixed: it is not bolometric values that can be adjusted,
              but monochromatic ones.
2002-02­28: - PHOEBE-0.11 pre-release version released.
            - GUI has been changed even further: "Exotic" tab was renamed
              to "Orbit", since it contains orbital parameters. Some space
              is reserved for Roche lobe graph and slice diagrams. A new
              tab has been created, "Luminosities", where all HLA and CLA
              variables are put. Third light (EL3) support has been added.
              The order of tabs has been changed to more meaningful order.
2002-02-26: - RV plotting was accidentally turned off in PHOEBE-0.10. It is
              now fixed and it uses FORTRAN routines for LCI creation.
2002-02-25: - GUI has been changed to contain DEL parameters for fitting.
2002-02-22: - PHOEBE-0.10 pre-release version released. This version is in-
              tended only and explicitly for LCI compatibility testing pur-
              poses.

Prior version of PHOEBE-0.10 was called WDGUI - Wilson-Devinney Graphical
User Interface. Since that version was only a model for PHOEBE, this is a
ChangeLog for PHOEBE-0.10 onward. If you wish to see prior ChangeLog file,
please download the outdated WDGUI package.
