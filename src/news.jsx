                Dear Colleagues,
              </p>
              <p>
                We will be holding the Third PHOEBE Workshop at Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA, <b>June 22nd - July 3rd, 2020</b>.
                This year the workshop will cover two weeks: with the first week covering an introduction to PHOEBE and the second week covering fitting and advanced scientific topics of interest (such as pulsations).
                Participants can choose to register for either week or both, depending on their interest and current level of comfort with using PHOEBE.
                Past participants are welcome and encouraged to apply to attend the second week if they wish to get more experience in particular areas of science or work on fitting their data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further information and the registration form can be found at <Link to="/workshops/2020june">http://phoebe-project.org/workshops/2020june</Link>.  Registration is now open and will remain open until <b>February 14th, 2020</b>.
              </p>

                The phoebe-project.org website has been re-written (and is now also <Link to="http://github.com/phoebe-project/phoebe-project.org">open-source</Link>) to improve the ability to navigate the tutorials and documentation for various releases.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Documentation will be preserved for each minor release.  All internal links will point to the latest release, but you can use the version switcher in the lower-right to access old releases.  For example, you can still access <Link to="/docs/2.0">docs for PHOEBE 2.0.x here</Link>.</li>
                <li>Information about each release, including changelog for each bugfix release, has been moved from the Documentation page to the <Link to="/releases">Releases</Link> page.</li>
                <li>Installation instructions, per-release, can now be found on the dedicated <Link to="/install">Install</Link> page.</li>
                <li>The FAQ has been moved from buried deep at the bottom of the documentation page to its own <Link to="/help/faq">FAQ page</Link> under the "Help" dropdown in the menu.</li>
                <li>The <Link to="/docs">Documentation</Link> page is now subdivided into several categories: <Link to="/docs/latest/tutorials">tutorials</Link>, <Link to="/docs/latest/datasets">datasets</Link>, <Link to="/docs/latest/physics">physics</Link>, <Link to="/docs/latest/examples">examples</Link>, and <Link to="/docs/latest/api">API documentation</Link>.</li>
                <li>The <Link to="/docs/latest/api">API Documentation</Link> is now formatted much cleaner and is simpler to navigate.  All backend and developer methods are hidden to avoid adding noise.</li>
                <li>A warning is shown on the install and documentation pages if viewing documentation for an older release.  Consider upgrading, or at least double-checking that your version of PHOEBE matches the docs you're reading.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Along with these changes, each page includes a link to submit a bug report on <em>that particular page's content</em>.  We try to keep the tutorials and API's updated for each minor release of PHOEBE, but we're hoping this will make it easier to report any discrepancies or need for further explanation in the docs.

                With the gradual transition of development from PHOEBE 2.0 alpha to beta we have redesigned our entire website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Until the beta version is fully tested and officially released, we highly suggest NOT using it for actual science.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>PHOEBE 1.0 (legacy) should be used if you want to get any trustable science results</li>
                <li>PHOEBE 2.0 alpha should be used if you want to play with support for new physics and observables, but should not be used for science and is no longer actively supported. Documentation and tutorials may be slightly out-of-date, but will remain available online for the near future.</li>
                <li>PHOEBE 2.0 beta should be used to learn the interface for PHOEBE going forward and for testing, but should not be used for science results until officially released. Watch here or subscribe to the phoebe announcements mailing list to be notified when the beta version is officially released. If you do choose to give the development version a try, please contact us.</li>

In the process of validating the backend, we are playing with temperature distributions. Here is a movie of a very realistic temperature distribution, featuring our two developers Kyle and Bert.

                Dear PHOEBE enthusiasts,
              </p>
               <p>
                   It is our immense pleasure to introduce the alpha version of PHOEBE 2.0! After nearly 4 years of design and work, PHOEBE has been rebuilt from scratch. In includes completely new paradigms that allow the users to model virtually any configuration of opaque systems on the sky. Alongside the release we are unveiling the new webpage that has been modernized and we believe that it will provide a good resource for modeling binary stars and more. As we continue to work on PHOEBE and its website, we kindly invite you to give this alpha release a go and tell us <Link to="mailto:phoebe-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">what you think</Link>! Start with the About (link removed) section, continue to the Download (link removed) section and give the Documentation (link removed) a whirl. Before using PHOEBE 2.0-alpha for any scientific work, please carefully read the Release Notes (link removed).
               </p>
               <p>
                 Wishing you an enjoyable experience while taking the new PHOEBE for a spin!

                The PHOEBE development team announces the 5th power-meeting taking place in Nijmegen, Netherlands. Power meetings are 1- to 2-week get-togethers of developers devoted to brainstorming and implementation of new ideas. With everyone away from their daily obligations for a couple of weeks, we focus solely on PHOEBE development in a collaborative, productive environment. The 5th power-meeting in Nijmegen is devoted to the finalization of the front-end, thorough testing of the back-end and, barring any major show-stoppers, the release of the official PHOEBE 2.0 version. If you would like to join us at the power-meeting, please send us an email to phoebe-devel@list.sourceforge.net.
